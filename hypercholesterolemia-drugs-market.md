<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hypercholesterolemia Drugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Statins</li><li>Non-Statins</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hypercholesterolemia drugs market is primarily divided into two categories: statins and non-statins. Statins, such as atorvastatin and simvastatin, are widely prescribed to lower LDL cholesterol levels by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme involved in cholesterol production in the liver. Non-statins include drugs like ezetimibe, which reduces cholesterol absorption in the intestines, and PCSK9 inhibitors, which enhance the liver's ability to clear LDL from the bloodstream. Both types play crucial roles in managing elevated cholesterol levels and reducing cardiovascular risk.</p></p>
